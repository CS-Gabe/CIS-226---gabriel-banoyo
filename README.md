Hi, Dr. Sletten

My name is Gabriel Banoyo. I am taking this class to gain foundational knowledge for my career in Ethical Hacking. After reviewing the assignment schedule calendar, I believe this course is a good start. I began with the course CIS106 Intro to Programming last year and learned some general knowledge about Python and programming itself. Now that this course has started, I am finally learning skills specific to my chosen field, which motivates me to continue developing the expertise needed for a successful Ethical Hacker
